# PortalAssa
This is a project of Micro service using Go, Next.Js, MongoDB, TypeScript and gRPC. 
The system was design to read a inbox using microsoft graph , categorize the email and send to a service who was responsible to comunicate to the front-end using websocket.
The front end would show the received messages.

Unfortunatelly this project is not yet finished.
